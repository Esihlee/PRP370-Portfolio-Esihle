# Reflection (STAR Technique)

## Situation
As part of my Professional Networking activity, I created a short introduction video to present myself professionally to potential employers and connections on LinkedIn. The goal was to build my online presence and showcase my communication skills.

## Task
My responsibility was to create a professional and engaging video that clearly communicated who I am, my background in ICT Application Development, and my career goals. The video needed to make a positive impression and help me connect with people in the tech industry.

## Action
I planned the video by writing a short script highlighting my studies, technical skills, and passion for UI/UX design and app development. I practiced speaking clearly and confidently, recorded the video using proper lighting and posture, and uploaded it to my LinkedIn profile. I also interacted with others by commenting on their posts and connecting with professionals in similar fields.

## Result
The video helped me present myself confidently and professionally online. I received positive feedback from peers and new connections, and it increased my confidence in networking digitally. This experience taught me the importance of personal branding and clear communication when building professional relationships.
