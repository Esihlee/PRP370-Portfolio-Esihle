# Reflection (STAR Technique)

## Situation
As part of my professional development, I completed a module on Interview Skills to prepare for future job opportunities and internships. I wanted to improve my confidence and learn how to present myself effectively during interviews.

## Task
My goal was to understand how to communicate my strengths and experiences clearly, answer common interview questions with confidence, and make a positive impression on potential employers.

## Action
I learned about the CAR (Context, Action, Result) method for structuring answers, researched how to respond to common questions such as “Tell me about yourself” and “What is your greatest weakness,” and practiced speaking confidently. I also learned the importance of researching a company before an interview to tailor my responses to their goals and values.

## Result
After completing the module, I felt more confident about attending interviews. I now know how to prepare effectively, highlight my achievements using the CAR method, and communicate professionally. These skills will help me make a strong impression in future interviews.
