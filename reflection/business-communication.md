# Reflection (STAR Technique)

## Situation
During my Work Integrated Learning at Plum Systems, I worked on improving an existing hosting website that the company was already using. The goal was to make the website look more modern and appealing to a wider audience, including young professionals and older users.

## Task
My responsibility was to enhance the website’s design and functionality so that it clearly communicated a modern and trustworthy image. I needed to ensure the website “screamed recent” — visually fresh, clean, and user-friendly — while still being professional enough to attract different types of clients.

## Action
I analyzed the existing website to identify outdated design elements and areas for improvement in layout, responsiveness, and user experience. I then updated the color scheme, typography, and overall layout to make it more visually engaging and intuitive. I also optimized the site’s performance for faster loading and smoother navigation. After implementing the changes, I presented the improved version to my supervisor and colleagues, explaining the design decisions and technical improvements.

## Result
The updated website successfully achieved a more modern and attractive look. My supervisor and colleagues were impressed with the balance between professional and youthful design. This project strengthened my skills in UI/UX design and communication, as I learned how to tailor a website’s look and feel to appeal to different audiences while explaining my design choices clearly.
